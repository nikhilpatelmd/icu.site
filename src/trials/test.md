## Clinical Context

Following the results of [INTERACT-2](/trials/interact-2) published in 2013, many were encouraged about a probable beneficial effect of intensive blood pressure reduction on death and disability in ICH. The [2015 AHA Guidelines](https://doi.org/10.1161/str.0000000000000069) reflected this optimism by stating that "acute lowering of SBP to 140 mmHg is safe and can be effective for improving functional outcome" for patients presenting with SBP between 150-220 mmHg.

There remained some lingering concerns. Primarily, it was unclear how robust the benefit of intensive blood pressure lowering actually was, given the relatively wide confidence intervals for the primary outcome. From the perspective of clinicians in the United States, the external validity was also unclear given the large proportion of patients recruited from China and the corresponding frequent use of urapidil, a BP-lowering agent not available in the United States.

ATACH-2 attempted to replicate the results of INTERACT-2 with some modifications: using predominantly a single BP-lowering agent (nicardipine), enrolling patients earlier (within 4.5 hours compared to 6), trying to achieve BP control faster (within 1 hour of enrollment), and achieving even more aggressive BP control.

## Patient Population

Patients were included if they presented with an ICH **within 4.5 hours of symptom onset and had at least one SBP reading > 180 mm Hg**. They were excluded if the admission GCS was < 5 or ICH volume > 60 mL.

The average age of the population was 62 years of age, with roughly 2/3 being male and half the population recruited from Asia (China, Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea). The other half were recruited from the US and Germany.

**Most patients had mild to moderate ICH**: over 80% of patients presented with a GCS 12 or greater, with median NIHSS of 11, and median ICH volume of 10 mL (10% of patients had a volume > 30 mL). Most had a deep location ICH (\~ 80%) and 1/4 had IVH.

This population is very similar to the INTERACT-2 cohort. **Unlike that trial, ATACH-2 did not have an SBP ceiling for recruitment, resulting in a higher SBP on presentation (200 mmHg vs. 179).** The other difference between the trials is the recruitment sites, with patients from China making up less of the cohort in ATACH-2.

## Study Design

This was a multicenter, international with a PROBE design involving > 100 sites.

- Average minimum SBP during the first 24 hours was very intense in both groups
-

## Results

**Primary Outcome**: Death or major disability at 3 months as defined by <span class="color">modified Rankin score of 4-6</span>

(This is slightly different to [INTERACT-2](/interact-2), which used mRS 3-6 as the definition of poor outcome)
